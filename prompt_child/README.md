# Amazon Bedrock Model Invocation Sample

## Description
This Python script demonstrates how to interact with Amazon Bedrock to invoke AI models using the AWS SDK (boto3). The sample shows how to set up a Bedrock client, make model invocations, and handle responses.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- AWS account with Bedrock access
- Configured AWS credentials
- Required Python packages:
  - boto3
  - json

## Installation
1. Clone this repository
2. Install required packages:
   
```
pip install boto3
```

## Configuration

Before running the script, you need to:

- Configure your AWS credentials
- Update the profile_name with your AWS profile
- Replace the modelId with your chosen Bedrock model ARN

## Features

- AWS Bedrock session initialization
- Model invocation with custom parameters
- JSON request and response handling
- Support for code analysis use cases

## Error Handling

The script includes basic response handling. For production use, consider adding:

- Error checking for AWS credentials
- Model invocation error handling
- Response validation

## Security Notes

- Never commit AWS credentials in your code
- Use environment variables or AWS profiles for authentication
- Ensure proper IAM permissions are set up
